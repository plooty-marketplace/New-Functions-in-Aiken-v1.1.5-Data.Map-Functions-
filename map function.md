## In Aiken-lang v1.1.5, 

## new functions related to Data.Map have been introduced to enhance the manipulation of map data structures. While specific details on these functions weren't provided in the search results, you can generally expect improvements in functionalities such as:

## Map Creation and Initialization

- Creating Maps: Functions to create new maps from lists of key-value pairs or from existing data structures.

- Map Access: Functions to retrieve values associated with specific keys, including safe access methods that return options to handle missing keys gracefully.

- Map Modification: Functions to add, update, or remove key-value pairs from maps, allowing for dynamic manipulation of map contents.

- Map Iteration: Functions to iterate over the keys and values in a map, enabling operations like filtering, transforming, or aggregating data.

- Map Conversion: Functions to convert maps to other data structures, such as lists or arrays, for easier processing in different contexts.
